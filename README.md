## Qatar museums 
Qatar Museums (QM) is the nation's preeminent institution for art and culture, providing authentic and inspiring 
cultural experiences through a growing network of museums, heritage sites, festivals, public art installations and 
programmes.

## Design challenge
Design and develop new features for the Qatar Museums Online Collection website.

There are a few features that we would like to see if you can design and develop. The design has a homepage with a so
called infinite canvas where users can scroll to in all directions (vertical and horizontal). The canvas is filled with
the objects from the API (randomized on load) and are repeated randomly on the canvas. The objects are clickable and when clicked they open 
a detail page of this object (out of scope for this challenge). 

The landingpage has filters, which on hover 'dim' objects that are not applicable to that filter. The filters are 
clickable as well, and lead the user to the search page (not in scope).

This page needs to be SEO friendly, accessible (keyboard navigation) and responsive (work on mobile and tablet as well).
If you can make it perform well, that would be a big plus.
To top it off, this pages is also multilingual (English and Arabic). Which means you need to accomodate for RTL text 
direction as well.

Progressive enhancement is allowed (e.g. slightly different behaviour on mobile or older browsers) but it should 
work in any major desktop browser.
