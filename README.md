## Qatar museums 
Qatar Museums (QM) is the nation's preeminent institution for art and culture, providing authentic and inspiring cultural experiences through a growing network of museums, heritage sites, festivals, public art installations and programmes.

## Design challenge
Design and develop new features for the Qatar Museums website.

### Features

#### Online Collections
based on collection object information for teh Qatar Museums website we need a seemingly infinite canvas with objects where users interact with (panning and zooming). This needs to be a ‘SEO friendly’ canvas, so the actual use of the canvas HTML element will most likely not suffice.
